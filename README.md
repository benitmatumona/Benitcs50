# CS50 projects in python 

# problem sets from the CS50 course in python all in one repsito

These are project from CS50 course starting from the basics (like a simple program 
that prompts the user from and input returns it all in lowercaes) to an advance 
level (like dealing with unit test, JASON, and APIs).

## Indoor Voice
This is a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should will be outputted unchanged
## Playback Speed

## Making Faces

## Einstein 
This is a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assuming that the user will input an integer.
## Tip Calculator 
this file will have two functions (apart from the main function). listed below 
The first one is called dollars_to_float, which accepts a str as input (e.g $120.00), remove the leading $, and return the amount as a float( e.g from $120.00 to 120.00). 
The second one is percent_to_float, which should accept a str as input (e.g 70%), remove the trailing %, and return the percentage as a float(e.g from 70% to 70.00.

## more information 
more information will be added once the more projects are done
