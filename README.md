# Problem sets from the CS50 course in python all in one repository 

These are project from CS50 course starting from the basics (like a simple program 
that prompts the user from and input returns it all in lowercaes) to an advance 
level (like dealing with unit test, JASON, and APIs).

## Indoor Voice
This is a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should will be outputted unchanged
## Playback Speed
This is a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... this is in order to give an effect of slowing down the speech.
## Making Faces
This is a function that accepts a str as input and returns that same input with any :) converted to üôÇ and any :( converted to üôÅ . All other text will be returned unchanged.
## Einstein 
This is a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assuming that the user will input an integer.
## Tip Calculator 
This file will have two functions (apart from the main function). listed below 
The first one is called dollars_to_float, which accepts a str as input (e.g $120.00), remove the leading $, and return the amount as a float( e.g from $120.00 to 120.00). 
The second one is percent_to_float, which should accept a str as input (e.g 70%), remove the trailing %, and return the percentage as a float(e.g from 70% to 70.00.

## Deep Thought 
This is a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, outputting Yes if the user inputs 42 or (case-insensitively) forty-two or forty two. If none of the previous options are tyed it outputs No.

## Home Federal Savings Bank
This is a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with ‚Äúhello‚Äù the output is $0. If the greeting starts with an ‚Äúh‚Äù (but not ‚Äúhello‚Äù) the output is $20. Otherwise the output is $100. It will ignore any leading whitespace in the user‚Äôs greeting and it will treat the user‚Äôs greeting case-insensitively.

## File Extensions
This is a program that prompts the user for the name of a file and then outputs that file‚Äôs media type if the file‚Äôs name ends (case-insensitively) in any of these suffixes: jpg, jpeg, gif, jng, text, pdf and zip. If the file name doesn't end wih any of the above it will output application/octet-stream.

## Math Interpreter

This is a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point rounded off to one decimal place. This program assumes that the user‚Äôs input will be formatted as x y z with one space between characters(e.e 1 + 4 / 3) and it also assumes that the denominator is not equals to zero.

## Meal Time 
This is a program that prompts the user for a time(weather it's 24 hour format e.g 17:00, or 12 hour format e.g 9:00 a.m. or 9:00 p.m.) outputs whether it‚Äôs breakfast time, lunch time, or dinner time. If it‚Äôs not time for a meal, it won't output anything at all. Each meal‚Äôs time range is inclusive.The program assumes the the user will enter valid input according to the examples in the brackets above.

## Camel Case
This is a program that prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and outputs the corresponding name in snake case(e.g from "camelCase" to "camel_case". This program assume that the user‚Äôs input will indeed be in camel case.

## Coke Machine 
This is a program that prompts the user to insert a coin, into a machine that sells coke do 50 cents. The machine only accept 5, 10 and 25 cents. Each time the user inserts a coin it informs the user of the amount due. Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents it will output how many cents in change the user is owed. This program assumes that the user will only input integers and ignores any integer that isn‚Äôt an accepted

## Just Setting Up My TWTTR.

This is a program that prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase. this program mimics Twitter shortcut by removing vowels for works (e.g from "How are you doing" to "Hw r y dng").
